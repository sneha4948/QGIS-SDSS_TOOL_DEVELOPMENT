# Introduction
The path shown on qgis for "shortest distance between two points" is through the road network. However, when displaying the shortest path for a set of nodes, qgis shows the eucledian path to avoid bad visualisation.  But, in order to know the actual walking/travelling route, it should be able to show the road network route shortest path. 
- Hence, Updation of this OD matrix from points as lines has been done. 
- Changes made in this file are taken from the " Shortest distance between two points" algorithm file.
- Updated_OdMatrixFromPointsAsLines.py is the updated python code file.
- Precise Changes made at chunks of codes can be found at: Updation of OD matrix from points as Lines.txt
